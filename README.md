# forkify

forkify is a web app meant to help users find recipes. Users can search for recipes, view the ingredients and adjust serving sizes, and go to the original website of the recipe to view cooking instructions. Additionally, users can bookmark recipes for later use, as well as uploading their own recipes whether it's online or not, only visible for themselves.
